# ♫ Jammming Playlist Maker ♫

If you're tired of Spotify's UI you can use this handy little react web-app to quickly search Spotify's library of music and create a playlist to your own Spotify account.

## This app interacts with Spotify's API.

Jammming's app status is 'Development mode' meaning not anybody can just use the app straight away. You'll have to implement your own client ID or contact me so I can add you as an authorized user under my client ID.

## I'm sure you know how React works

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can run this command in development mode by running this in your terminal at the root of this project

### `npm start`

You'll find the app running at http://localhost:3000

It's a live server so you'll see any edits in realtime. It's also great for debugging! Happy coding from Vic.

### This was created as a project for Codecademy's web developer course.
